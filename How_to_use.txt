Step 1. Run make_dirs.py through terminal to create necessary directories to store spectral data.

Step 2. Place the synthetic spectra in Data/SYNTHETIC/Raw
Step 3. Run batch_normize.py through terminal in Synthetic_Spec_Processing to normalize all synthetic spectra.
Step 4. Run convolve.py through terminal in Synthetic_Spec_Processing to convolve all normalized synthetic spectra.


Step 5. Place the observed spectra in Data/OBSERVED/Raw
Step 6. Run normalize_rvcorr.py in Observed_Spec_Processing to normalize and RV correct all observed spectra.

Step 7. Run mcmc.py in Parameter_Estimation after doing the necessary modifications.
